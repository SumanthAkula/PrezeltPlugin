# PrezeltPlugin

this plugin basically just adds pretzel sticks to minecraft. sadly I can't add pretzels cuz I can't add new textures.  

## questions that nobody ever asked, but I'll answer anyway:
> What can you do with a pretzel stick?

Absolutely nothing! You could put it in an item frame if you feel like it but that's about it.  

> How do I get a pretzel stick?

There are a few ways:
* You have a 10% chance of getting one if you kill a Wither
* You have a 1% chance of getting one if you kill a charged creeper
* You have a 25% chance of getting one if you kill the Ender Dragon
* You can run a command to get it if you have permissions for it

> Why is the title of the plugin misspelled?

Next question.  

## Commands:
* `/givepretzel [player]` 
  * the `[player]` part is optional if the command is run by a player who is online.  If run from the server console, the `[player]` part is required.  To run this command, you either gotta be a server operator, or have the `prezelt.givepretzel.use` permission.  
* `/prezelt_reload`
  * reloads `config.yml`
  * requires the `prezelt.reload.use` permission
  
## Permissions:
* `prezelt.givepretzel.use` gives you permission to use the `/givepretzel [pretzel]` command
* `prezelt.reload.use` gives you permission to reload the plugin's config file
